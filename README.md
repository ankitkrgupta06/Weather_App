# 🌦️ Weather App

## 📌 Project Description
The Weather App is a simple web application built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that allows users to check real-time weather information for any city in the world. The app fetches live weather data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** and displays key details such as temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed.

Users can enter a city name into the input field and click the search button to retrieve weather details. The application uses the **Fetch API** with **async/await** for handling asynchronous requests and includes proper input validation and error handling to manage invalid city names, API errors, or network issues.

The user interface is styled using CSS with a clean, card-based layout and background imagery. This project demonstrates essential frontend development concepts including API integration, DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive UI design.
